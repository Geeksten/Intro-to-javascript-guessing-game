    <h1>A Javascript Word Scramble Game</h1>

            // Grab the corresponding scrambled word from the SCRAMBLED array - we need a way to access the index. In python, we have .index() method. GOOGLE: Does Javascript have something similar?
            var randWordindex = WORDS.indexOf(gameWord);
            var scrambledWord = SCRAMBLED[randWordindex];

            // prompt the user to guess the original word when given the scrambled word. READ about the window.prompt() and window.alert() Javascript method.

            var userGuess = prompt("Can you unscramble this word?\n" + scrambledWord + " \nEnter your guess! "); 

            // If the user guesses wrong, tell them they were wrong and the right word. IF wrong --> tell them they were wrong (prompt). ELSE IF --> right, CONGRATULATE!

                alert("Oops! Not quite right! Please guess again.");

            playing = confirm("Press OK To keep playing or Cancel to quit");

            // What does confirm() return? Confirm result is a boolean value OK = true and Cancel = False
            // What does setting the playing variable do?
